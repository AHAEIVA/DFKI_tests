## Abstract

*(Approx. 0.5 pages)*

Motion planning for tethered robots operating in complex, three-dimensional environments presents significant challenges due to the need to manage the tether's configuration and avoid collisions involving both the robot body and the flexible tether. This paper introduces a robust motion planning framework that integrates sampling-based planning using the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) with dense, voxel-based environment mapping, specifically leveraging NVBlox for efficient distance field computation. We propose methods for explicitly representing the tether's geometry and incorporating tether-specific constraints, such as maximum length and collision avoidance, directly into the planning process. Our approach utilizes customized state validity checkers and motion validators within OMPL that query the dense map (represented as a Signed Distance Field - SDF) to ensure collision-free paths for both the robot and the estimated tether shape. Furthermore, we present strategies for path post-processing, including smoothing and simplification, as well as reactive replanning mechanisms to adapt to dynamic changes or refine paths based on updated tether configurations. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated through simulations involving complex geometries representative of inspection or exploration tasks.

## I. Introduction

*(Approx. 1 page)*

Tethered robots, such as Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) in underwater inspection or robots operating in confined spaces, offer advantages like continuous power supply and high-bandwidth communication. However, the presence of the tether introduces significant complexity to motion planning [1]. The tether itself can collide with the environment, become entangled, or exert forces on the robot, restricting its maneuverability. Planning feasible and safe paths requires not only considering the robot's kinematics and dynamics but also the continuous configuration of the flexible tether connecting it to a base station.

Traditional motion planning approaches often simplify the environment or the tether model, which may not be suitable for operations in cluttered and geometrically complex 3D spaces encountered in real-world applications like infrastructure inspection, search and rescue, or planetary exploration. Sampling-Based Motion Planners (SBMPs), such as those implemented in the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) [2], have proven effective for high-dimensional problems but require careful adaptation to handle tether constraints efficiently. Key challenges include: 1) Representing the complex 3D environment accurately and efficiently querying it for collisions. 2) Modeling the tether's shape and constraints realistically without prohibitive computational cost. 3) Integrating tether collision checking and constraint satisfaction seamlessly within the planning loop. 4) Developing strategies for robust replanning when the tether configuration changes or initial plans become invalid.

Recent advances in dense mapping techniques, such as Truncated Signed Distance Fields (TSDFs) generated by systems like NVBlox [3], provide detailed, voxelized representations of the environment that facilitate rapid collision checking and distance queries. Integrating these dense maps with SBMPs offers a promising direction for tether-aware planning.

This paper presents a motion planning framework specifically designed for tethered robots operating in complex 3D environments mapped using dense reconstruction techniques. Our main contributions are:
*   An integrated planning system utilizing OMPL planners (e.g., RRT*) with dense environment representations (NVBlox SDFs and/or mesh models via FCL [4]) for efficient collision checking.
*   Customized OMPL state validity checkers and motion validators that explicitly account for collisions of both the robot body and a discretized representation of the tether against the dense map or mesh.
*   Methods for managing tether length constraints and incorporating tether geometry into the planning search space or validity checks.
*   Techniques for path post-processing (smoothing, simplification) and replanning to generate feasible and efficient trajectories for tethered systems.

The proposed approach aims to generate collision-free, constraint-aware paths for tethered robots, enabling safer and more autonomous operations in challenging environments. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section II discusses related work, Section III details our methodology, Section IV presents simulation results (or discusses implementation details based on the codebase), and Section V concludes the paper.

## II. Related Works

*(Approx. 1 page)*

Motion planning for tethered robots has been an active area of research, driven by applications in underwater robotics, aerial systems, and confined space exploration. Early approaches often simplified the tether dynamics or geometry, treating it as a straight line or neglecting its volume for collision checking, which limits applicability in cluttered environments [5].

More sophisticated methods attempt to model the tether more accurately. Some works represent the tether as a series of connected rigid links or a kinematic chain, allowing standard robot planning algorithms to be applied, but potentially at high computational cost [6]. Other approaches use physics-based simulations, such as mass-spring models or Finite Element Methods (FEM), to capture tether flexibility and dynamics [7]. While providing high fidelity, these simulations can be computationally intensive, making their direct integration into real-time planning loops challenging. Simplified dynamic models, considering tension and catenary effects, have also been proposed as a compromise [8].

Integrating tether constraints within sampling-based planners like RRT or PRM is a common strategy. This often involves customizing the state validity checking step. For instance, planners might check collisions along a discretized representation of the tether path corresponding to a given robot state [9]. The definition of the tether path itself varies, from simple straight-line connections to more complex estimations based on previous configurations or simplified physics [10]. Some works explicitly include tether configuration variables in the state space, leading to higher dimensionality but potentially more accurate planning [11]. Managing tether length constraints is also crucial, often handled by rejecting samples or paths that exceed the maximum allowable length.

Environment representation plays a critical role. Octrees [12] and voxel grids have been used, but querying for collisions, especially for the continuous tether shape, can be inefficient. Signed Distance Fields (SDFs), particularly when computed efficiently on GPUs using methods like NVBlox [3] or VDB-based approaches [13], offer advantages for rapid proximity queries. Representing the environment as meshes and using libraries like FCL [4] is another common approach, particularly effective for static environments or when high-fidelity geometric checks are needed.

Compared to existing works, our approach focuses on the tight integration of OMPL-based sampling planners with dense, SDF-based environment representations (specifically NVBlox) for efficient collision checking of both the robot and a volumetric tether model. We leverage customized validity checkers within OMPL that directly query the SDF, aiming for a balance between tether representation fidelity and planning efficiency suitable for complex 3D scenarios. Furthermore, our framework incorporates path post-processing and replanning strategies tailored for tethered systems operating in potentially dynamic or partially known environments.

## III. Methodology

*(Approx. 1.5 pages)*

Our proposed tether-aware motion planning framework integrates several components: dense environment mapping, efficient collision checking for both robot and tether, explicit tether modeling, a sampling-based path planning core, and path post-processing/replanning capabilities. Figure \[Fig:SystemOverview] illustrates the overall architecture. *(Note: Add a system overview figure later)*

### A. Environment Representation

Accurate and efficient environment representation is crucial for collision avoidance in complex 3D spaces. Our framework supports multiple representations:

1.  **Dense Voxel Mapping (NVBlox):** We primarily leverage NVBlox [3] to build and maintain a dense Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF) and optionally an Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) of the environment from sensor data (e.g., depth cameras). The SDF provides rapid O(1) lookup of the distance to the nearest surface for any point in the mapped space, which is highly beneficial for collision checking. Functions like `initializeNVBlox`, `mapFromEIVA`, `mapFromPipe`, and `mapFromPointCloud` handle the creation and population of the NVBlox map layers (`nvblox::TsdfLayer`, `nvblox::EsdfLayer`).

2.  **Mesh-based Models (STL/PCD):** For known static structures or obstacles, we can incorporate explicit mesh models, typically loaded from STL or PCD files using libraries like PCL and FCL [4]. Functions like `readSTLFile`, `loadXYZFileToPCL`, and `initializeSTLMesh` manage the loading and preprocessing (e.g., scaling, transformation) of these mesh representations. These are often converted into `fcl::CollisionObjectf` for use with the FCL collision checking library.

### B. Collision Checking

Efficient collision checking is performed against the chosen environment representation(s).

1.  **Robot Body Collision:** The robot is typically modeled as a simplified geometric primitive (e.g., sphere, box) or a collection of primitives. Collisions are checked by querying the environment representation at the robot's location.
    *   Against NVBlox SDF: We query the SDF value at the robot's center. A collision is detected if the distance is less than a threshold corresponding to the robot's radius plus a safety margin (`CollisionChecker::isCollisionFree`). Gradient information from the ESDF (`getESDFGradient`) can also be utilized for reactive control or potential field methods, although not explicitly detailed in the planning core functions found.
    *   Against Meshes (FCL): We create an `fcl::CollisionObjectf` for the robot's geometry and perform discrete collision detection against the `fcl::CollisionObjectf` representing the environment mesh using FCL's collision algorithms (`CollisionCheckSTL`, `isStateValidSTL`).

2.  **Tether Collision:** Checking collisions along the entire tether length is critical. We represent the planned tether path as a sequence of discrete points or segments (derived from the OMPL path). Collision checking involves iterating along this discretized tether representation:
    *   Each point or segment center is checked against the NVBlox SDF or FCL mesh similar to the robot body check.
    *   A collision is flagged if any part of the discretized tether representation penetrates an obstacle beyond a defined safety threshold. The `CustomMotionValidator` likely implements checks along the straight-line path between two states, potentially sampling points along the line and checking each for validity, including tether checks.

### C. Tether Modeling and Constraints

We model the tether geometrically and enforce constraints during planning:

1.  **Geometric Representation:** The tether's path between the anchor point and the robot's current position is represented by the sequence of waypoints generated by the OMPL planner. While this doesn't model complex physics like catenary effects or elasticity directly, it provides a geometric path used for length calculation and collision checking. Functions like `InvertTetherPath` and path manipulation functions in `TetherPlanner` operate on this representation.

2.  **Length Constraint:** The total length of the planned tether path is calculated by summing the Euclidean distances between consecutive waypoints (`findTetherLength`, `findTetherLengthReplannedPath`). During planning, states or motions that would result in a tether path exceeding a predefined maximum length (`tether_params.yaml: max_tether_length`) are deemed invalid.

3.  **Collision Avoidance:** As described in Section III-B, collisions between the discretized tether path and the environment are checked during state validity and motion validation steps within OMPL. Strategies like offsetting the path (`OffsetPath`, `OffSetTetherPath_STL`) or modifying the path based on proximity to obstacles (`PopPathWithNormals`, `PopTetherCentroid`) appear to be implemented to explicitly manage tether clearance.

### D. Path Planning Framework

We utilize the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) [2] as the core planning engine.

1.  **State Space:** The primary planning is done in the robot's configuration space, typically SE(3) or R^3 depending on whether orientation is critical. `ompl::base::RealVectorStateSpace` is used, configured with appropriate bounds (`initializeOMPLSpace`).

2.  **Planner:** While various OMPL planners can be used, RRT* (`ompl::geometric::RRTstar`) is often suitable for finding asymptotically optimal paths, though others like RRT-Connect may be used for faster initial solutions. The `ompl::geometric::SimpleSetup` class is used to configure the planning problem (`tether_planner_main.cpp`).

3.  **State Validity Checking:** This is the crucial step where environment collisions and tether constraints are checked. We implement custom state validity checking functions (`isStateValid`, `isStateValidSTL`) registered with the OMPL `SpaceInformation` object (`si`). These functions perform the robot and tether collision checks described in Section III-B and verify the tether length constraint (Section III-C).

4.  **Motion Validation:** OMPL planners require validating the motion (path segment) between two states. The default checks discrete points along the straight-line path. We use a `CustomMotionValidator` which likely performs more rigorous checks, potentially sampling more densely or using specific tether interpolation logic, to ensure the continuous path segment is collision-free for both robot and tether.

### E. Path Post-Processing and Replanning

Raw paths generated by SBMPs are often jerky and non-optimal. We employ post-processing and replanning techniques:

1.  **Path Smoothing/Simplification:** OMPL's built-in `PathSimplifier` is used (`ompl::geometric::PathSimplifier`). Additionally, custom smoothing techniques based on polynomial fitting (`smoothPathWithPolynomial`, `smoothPathWith5thOrderPolynomial`, `smoothPathWithSpline`) are implemented to generate smoother, more executable trajectories.

2.  **Replanning:** The framework includes mechanisms for replanning when necessary. This can be triggered by changes in the environment, detection of imminent collisions during execution, or the need to find alternative routes if the current path becomes infeasible. Functions like `ReplanPath`, `CalculateAlternativePath_i`, and `SearchAlternativePath` suggest strategies for finding new path segments or entirely new paths from the current robot state or an intermediate point on the existing path. The logic often involves identifying a problematic segment, finding a valid alternative around it, and splicing it back into the original path. Tether path manipulation functions (`PopPath`, `PopPathFirstPoint`, `PopPathSample`) are likely used to adjust the path based on proximity to obstacles or tether constraints during execution or replanning.

## IV. Conclusion

*(Approx. 0.5 pages)*

This paper presented a motion planning framework for tethered robots operating in complex 3D environments, leveraging the strengths of sampling-based planning with OMPL and dense environment mapping using NVBlox and/or mesh representations with FCL. We addressed the critical challenges of tether management by incorporating explicit geometric tether modeling, length constraints, and collision checking for both the robot and the tether directly within the OMPL planning pipeline via customized state validity and motion validators. The integration with dense SDF maps allows for efficient proximity queries, crucial for real-time performance in cluttered spaces. Furthermore, the framework includes path post-processing techniques like smoothing and simplification, alongside replanning capabilities to handle dynamic situations or refine initial paths.

The key contribution of this work lies in the tight integration of these components, providing a practical and robust solution for generating collision-free, constraint-aware trajectories for tethered systems. By explicitly considering the tether's geometry and potential collisions against detailed environment models, the planner enhances safety and autonomy for tasks such as underwater inspection, exploration in confined spaces, or other applications where tethers are necessary but pose significant planning challenges.

Future work could involve incorporating more sophisticated tether physics models (e.g., considering elasticity or catenary effects) if required by the application, potentially using simplified models within the planner or as a post-processing validation step. Investigating adaptive discretization strategies for tether collision checking and exploring different OMPL planners or optimization-based techniques for specific scenarios could further enhance performance and path quality. Integration with real robot hardware and extensive experimental validation in diverse, challenging environments remain important next steps. *(Note: Add specific results summary here once simulations/experiments are done)*.
