# Progress

## What Works

-   The Memory Bank system has been initialized with the core files:
    -   `projectbrief.md`
    -   `productContext.md`
    -   `activeContext.md`
    -   `systemPatterns.md`
    -   `techContext.md`
-   The `activeContext.md` file has been updated to reflect the current task.

## What's Left to Build

-   This `progress.md` file is being updated now.
-   The `.clinerules` file needs to be created.
-   Need to pull the README file from the remote repository.
-   Need to create or modify the `.gitignore` file to ignore the `models` and `input_data` folders.
-   Need to commit the changes.
-   Need to push the code to the remote repository.

## Current Status

-   Memory Bank initialization is nearly complete.
-   Ready to pull the README file from the remote repository.

## Known Issues

-   None at this time.
