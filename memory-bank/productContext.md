# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

This project exists to facilitate software development and version control using Git. It provides a structured environment for managing code changes, collaborating on features, and maintaining a history of development.

## Problems It Solves

- Tracks changes to code over time.
- Allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase concurrently.
- Enables reverting to previous versions of the code if necessary.
- Provides a clear history of who made what changes and when.

## How It Should Work

The project should allow users to perform standard Git operations (commit, push, pull, branch, merge, status, etc.) to manage their codebase effectively.

## User Experience Goals

- **Clarity:** Users should have a clear understanding of the current state of their repository.
- **Efficiency:** Git operations should be straightforward and quick to perform.
- **Reliability:** Version control should be robust and dependable.
