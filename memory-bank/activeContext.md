# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on pushing the codebase to the remote repository at https://github.com/AHAEIVA/DFKI_tests.git, while ignoring large files in the `models` and `input_data` folders.

## Recent Changes

- Read all Memory Bank files to understand the project context.

## Next Steps

1.  Pull the README file from the remote repository.
2.  Create or modify the `.gitignore` file to ignore the `models` and `input_data` folders.
3.  Commit the changes.
4.  Push the code to the remote repository.
5.  Update the `progress.md` file.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

-   Need to handle potentially large files in the `models` and `input_data` folders.
-   The remote repository URL is https://github.com/AHAEIVA/DFKI_tests.git.
